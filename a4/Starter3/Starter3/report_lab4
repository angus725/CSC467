Implementation of Non-trivial Math Operations:
	Negation: Implemented as subtraction from 0
	Logical Not: Implemented as multiply by -1

Boolean type:
	Boolean true is -1 false is +1. Done this way
	to fit the way CMP works

Constants:
	Abusing implicit constant register creation,
	a constant is handled by Mov temp_reg, literal

Code Generation:
	Declaration:
		Allocate a register for the variable and do a MOV if there is an expression,
		insert the register, var mapping into the var_reg_map

	Assignment:
		Generate a MOV instruction
	Variable:
		Find the register from the var_reg_map
	Constructor:
		Generate a MOV instruction for each vector component
	Func_call:
		Map to the equivalent ARB instructions
	UnaryOp and BinaryOp:
		Generate 1 or more instructions depending on the operation
