Our group broke down the work by splitting the productions rules in half.
Dependencies were resolved by giving one person all non-terminals,
and the other all identifiers.

2 Major challenges faced during this lab are shift/reduce conflicts
from the dangling else problem, and taking care of operator precedence.
In both cases the production rule given had to be modified,
and precedence has to be specified by adding explicit %prec.

We verified the solution by running the compiler with
trace flag -Tn on test cases we have written,
including both correct and incorrect tests.
